# Staking Rewards

### **Overview**

TGM.Bet offers substantial rewards for holders of $TGM tokens, especially for those who choose to stake their tokens. Staking is a way to encourage long-term holding of tokens. By staking $TGM, users can help stabilize the token’s value while also earning additional rewards and enjoying various benefits.

### **Basics of Staking $TGM**

**What is Staking?**

Staking involves locking a certain amount of $TGM tokens on the platform for a set period. During this time, stakers receive additional $TGM tokens as rewards, and in the 6-month locked pool, they also earn some Ethereum (Eth) as a reward, effectively earning interest on their staked amount.

### **Why Stake $TGM?**

Staking offers several advantages:

* **Passive Income**: Earn additional $TGM tokens and Eth (for the 6-month pool) through staking.
* **Platform Rewards**: Stakers receive special bonuses, offers, or priority access to games.
* **Supporting the Ecosystem**: Staking reduces the circulating supply of tokens, which helps stabilize and potentially increase the token’s value.

### **How Rewards are Distributed**

Rewards are calculated based on the amount staked and the duration. You can claim rewards anytime through the website, and these rewards can be used for casino games, restaked, or kept in your wallet. At the end of the staking period, you can withdraw your staked tokens and any unclaimed rewards.

**Staking Locking Period**

When you add tokens to the staking pool, they will be locked for the specified time.

* **10-Day Pool**: Adding extra tokens restarts the 10-day lock period.
* **3-Month Pool**: Adding extra tokens does not extend the lock time.
* **6-Month Pool**: Adding extra tokens does not extend the lock time.

Rewards accrued during the staking period can be claimed at any time and used for casino games, kept in your wallet, or restaked to increase holdings.

### **Security and Trust**

* **Smart Contract Assurance**: Staking is managed by smart contracts to ensure transparency and prevent malicious activities.
* **Periodic Audits**: Regular audits of the staking contract ensure its security and reliability.
* **Withdrawal Assurance**: Even though tokens are locked during the staking period, you can be assured of receiving your staked tokens and rewards at the end of the term.

### **Enhanced Ecosystem Engagement**

Staking $TGM also provides additional benefits:

* **Exclusive Access**: Stakers get first-hand access to new games, features, or promotional events.
* **Community Recognition**: Top stakers in the community are recognized, fostering healthy competition and further engagement.
